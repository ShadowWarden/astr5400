My solutions to the homeworks and project for ASTR 5400 (Fluid Dynamics)
at CU-Boulder. I probably won't update these once I get back my solutions,
so do not assume that these are correct (but, given my track record with
problem sets, they probably are).

Boilerplate stuff, since this is a repo for homework problems: I'm not
liable for any misuse of the files stored here. If you break your 
institutions honour code by copying my solutions, that's your problem - and
your problem alone.
